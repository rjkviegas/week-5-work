# JavaScript

### ```function``` 

```function``` is a keyword in JavaScript.

```function``` creates an object that can be **called** (invoke may be a better word to use).

This object is a new Function object.
```
var bark = function() {
  return 'Woof';
}

bark();
```
Paranthese must be included even if there are no arguments.
```return``` must be used explicitly.

Anonymous (no name) functions can be used in JavaScript. Like blocks in Ruby.
Anonymous functions passed to a named function are referred to as a **callback**.
